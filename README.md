# HeuristicMovingWindow/HeuristicMovingSum uses simple statistical methods to arrive at an approximate sum which can be substituted as the actual sample of those samples if the window size is really big, hence optimizing memory.

I will be adding metrics comparing actual and heuristic sums/averages to demonstrate the same.
